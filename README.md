Hi, welcome to this repo.  
My name is Fitransyah and I've created this repo for gamedev candidate test at Tematem Inc.

## Features

- Ease in revert effect when touch is released  

## Technical Notes

- Please be aware that some files may need to be ignored due to their size.  
- I will provide the full project zip file in the link below.
- There is also a recorded gameplay video for easier review.
- The CPP code and all assets are uploaded.
- I am using free assets from the internet for the player sprites.
- For the player sprites, I am creating a sprite sheet to save memory and for easier use.
- For the parallax scene, I need to modify the asset with Photoshop to expand it, allowing it to cover the parallax effect.
